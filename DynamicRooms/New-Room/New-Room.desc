The room is as empty as the vast emptiness of space. The room stretches on for
an infinity; dark and foreboding. This is a room that has just seen it's 
creation. Young and unfriendly to the explorerer, it speaks of new adventures 
and new dangers yet to come. Exploring this emptiness would would be unwise as
many foolish explorer has ventured into the realm of the emptiness and never
returned, for the emptiness is unforgiving to all.
