Welcome to the Murus Server

If you are reading this file you are obviously a new immortal (Congrats!), or you are the proud owner of a
the Murus Server Code. This document will outline all of the features that Zaos currently offers as well as
serving as a guide for future releases and update. Finally, this guide will also outline the steps to file
bug reports, suggest features, donate code :), or just get in touch with the dev's (Me).

---Current Features---
~NPC
	A NPC is a non playable character. These characters are controlled by the computer and help to guide 
	the user through quests, role play, and to provide opponents for the user. NPC's can be created by 
	entering the directory /NPC. Once in the NPC directory, add the name of the NPC that you wish to
	create.
~If an empty file names 'GOD' is placed in a users userProfile directory, the user becomes and administrator.
This currently allows then to stop the server with the 'stop' command.
