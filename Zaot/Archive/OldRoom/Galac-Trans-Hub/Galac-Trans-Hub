Galac Transport Hub
	The spacious marble room stands at the centre of the galaxy, 
a transport hub for the nine races of the Zaotion empire, and a symbol 
of peace.  The whole room is decked in beautiful marble, the ceiling 
being the most beautiful, a slab of black marble with the Zao 
constalations engraved.  On the floor, an ornate compase rose points 
in all directions.
