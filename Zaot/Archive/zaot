Descriptions of each race:
~Terrarians:
The Terrarians originated on planet Earth in the system Sol. 

It has often been said that in older times, the Earth was a marvel 
of planetary beauty. However, during the thrid and final tropospheric
revolution, much of Earth's naturaul beauty was transformed into 
industrial wasteland. The pollution ammount eventually became so 
high, it led the commander Julius the 3rd to remark idly, "The whole
quadrant at my hand, and a trash can at my disposal." 

The Terranians have always been at the forefront of the innovative 
worlds. Producing many galaxy renown scientists. Much of Earth's
technology is shared within the Zaotian Empire though their large 
pirate fleet is always equipped with the very latest. The Terrarians
are eager explorers and have many colonies spread throughout the 
galaxy.
	
Earth has a Military ruled government built on a system of Sars. 
Currently reigning is Sar Grule the 1st, whose diplomatic ties were 
severely crippled after the Croctail Nebula Ambush. Therefore the 
Tarrarians have very weak ties with the Solar Guards as well.

~Thaels
The Thaels lived a secluded life until about hte last century, when President Shael declared the massive Omae Nebula and all systems within it, to belong rightfully to the Zaotian Empire. This decree also included the system Benai, which contains their homeworld, Thaela.

Also within the last century, Thaela's former totalian government was overthrown, leading to a new era of peace. Election are held every two years in the 48th month, making space travel discouraged at that time.

The Thael's new democratic era was hailed by many races of the Zaotian Empire, and as a result, many high positions of the Sun Guard are held by Thaelian Citizens.

Although very pleasant, Thael's are feared on the battlefield. As depicted by several famous poems, including that of Firestar.

The Thaels have a very complex language called Flagstx which led to difficult diplomacy on their admittance to the empire, but as time went on more Thael's learned Zao. As a result only 1/2 of Thaels cannot speak Zao.

It has often been said that 'Curiosity killed the Zao', but contrary to popular belief the Thaelians are very active in technological developement.
