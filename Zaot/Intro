---Malta Project---
/Root Directory
-------------------
The root directory is the file in which the entire database resides. Since the server is separate from
the database, it is possible to run multiple databases, although not all at once.

In the root directory, each file correspondes to a certain feature within the mud, or a certain type
of information. For example, the file named NPC is devoted to Non-Playable-Characters, also known as
mobs. Each of these files will contain a readme that specifies how files in these directories are set
up. Since this database is also a fully functional server, as well as an example for those setting up
their own Malta Project servers, there are usually numerous examples of each feature within its 
corresponding directory. 

I hope that this series of readmes will help you to build a sucessful mud and this dataset will provide
an insightful look at an already established database. Although this database is distributed freely under
the GNU GPL V3.0 Liscence, it is hoped that individuals venturing into the wild world of mud creation
will find inspiration in their own hearts and instead of making a mud that is virtually indestinguishable
from the world of Zaot, will instead use this database as an exaple only and create their own unique world.
If you want to create an exact clone of Zaot, why don't you contribute directly to this server instead of
creating a clone?

I wish you well in your endeavors!
