---Programming With Rooms---
	~If you want a command to be displayed as the user moves in a
	 direction a file called room-name.d should be created. Where
	 the room-name is the name of the room in which the user is 
	 leaving from and the .d is the direction. IE (n, s, e, w, u, 
	 or d).

	 For Example if a user was leaving the dungeon and when they went
	 north you wanted it to say - "The stairs up from the dungeon are long
	 and steep" instead of the default "You go North"

	.ex is used for the 'examine' command.

	.map is used for room files that should display a small map of the immediate area on the left hand side of the 		screen

---Writing Room Descriptions---
	~Room descriptions should not contain 'you'
	~Room descriptions should have no more than 70 characters per line
