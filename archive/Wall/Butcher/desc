A long counter dominates the end of the room. Behind the counter on the wall are a wide assortment of sharp knives. The remaining walls are covered in the heads of every exotic animal imaginable. The low beam ceiling is covered in small sharp brass hooks upon which  large pieces of dried beef are skewered. There is a door to the west.
