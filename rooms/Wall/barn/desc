Bales of hay reach up to the ceiling along the north wall. The south wall is divided into cow stalls. The wooden slats of the floor are covered in an assortment of old hay and cow manure. A small wooden ladder is bolted to the wall which appears to lead up to a small loft. To the west are the huge wooden doors of the barn.
