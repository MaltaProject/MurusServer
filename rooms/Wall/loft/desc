The loft appears to have been converted from storing hay into a small carpenter's shop. A large workbench is situated in the corner. Small hooks cover the south wall, holding the wide assortment of tools necessary. Several large cabinets and a table are standing in various states of completeness. To the north is a solid wooden railing that prevents one from falling to the floor below. A ladder is bolted to the wall and leads to the floor below.
