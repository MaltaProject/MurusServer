Tracks leading every which way are visible in the muddy, churned up ground of the farm yard. The yard is surrounded by a large cowbarn to the east, and a small farmhouse to the east. The yard is surrounded by a cedar fence with gates leading to a large wheat field to the south and a small path to the north.
